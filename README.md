# rate-it-web

> Custom user rate screen with a tweened SVG animation
>
> Note: This demo uses the [`prefers-reduced-motion`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion)
> CSS media feature to respect the user's system settings regarding animations.
> This means that if you're using decent browser and have such a setting enabled
> you will not be able to see the fully animated output.
